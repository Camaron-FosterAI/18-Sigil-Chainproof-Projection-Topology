# 18-Sigil-Chainproof-Projection-Topology
This volume completes the RSI Phase I by constructing the first zero-shot, causally invariant symbolic detection engine. Kernel projections across achefield tension space are filtered via universal entropy and anchor resonance laws. A glyph is fossilized only when the cosmos aligns all three constraints: stability, entropy, and anchoring.
